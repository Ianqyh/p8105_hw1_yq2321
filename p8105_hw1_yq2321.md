# Problem 1

The code chunk below creates a data frame comprised of a random sample
of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution, a logical vector
indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0, a
character vector of length 10, and a factor vector of length 10, with 3
different factor “levels”. It also finds the mean of each variable in
the data frame.
