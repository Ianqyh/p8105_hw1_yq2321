# Problem 1

The code chunk below creates a data frame comprised of a random sample
of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution, a logical vector
indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0, a
character vector of length 10, and a factor vector of length 10, with 3
different factor “levels”. It also finds the mean of each variable in
the data frame.

``` r
df = tibble(
  vec_norm = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = vec_norm > 0,
  vec_char = c("My", "name", "is", "Yihan", "Qiu", "and", "I'm", "a", "graduate", "student"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("Asian", "White", "Black", "Asian", "White", "Black", "Asian", "White", "Black", "Asian"))
)
df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    vec_norm vec_logical vec_char vec_factor
    ##       <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1  -1.50   FALSE       My       Asian     
    ##  2  -0.771  FALSE       name     White     
    ##  3   0.684  TRUE        is       Black     
    ##  4   1.33   TRUE        Yihan    Asian     
    ##  5  -0.211  FALSE       Qiu      White     
    ##  6   0.254  TRUE        and      Black     
    ##  7  -0.539  FALSE       I'm      Asian     
    ##  8  -0.0883 FALSE       a        White     
    ##  9   0.138  TRUE        graduate Black     
    ## 10   0.324  TRUE        student  Asian

The code chunk below finds the mean of each variable in the data frame.

``` r
## Takes the mean of the random sample and it works
mean_vec_norm = mean(pull(df,vec_norm))
mean_vec_norm
```

    ## [1] -0.03758505

``` r
## Takes the mean of the logical vector and it works
mean_vec_logical = mean(pull(df, vec_logical))
mean_vec_logical
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
## Takes the mean of the character vector and it doesn't work
mean_vec_char = mean(pull(df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

``` r
mean_vec_char
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
## Takes the mean of the vector factor and it doesn't work
mean_vec_factor = mean(pull(df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_vec_factor
```

    ## [1] NA

The code chunk below tries to convert variables from one type to
another.

``` r
## Convert logical variable into numeric
as.numeric(pull(df, vec_logical))

## Convert character variable into numeric
as.numeric(pull(df, vec_char))

## Convert factor variable into numeric
as.numeric(pull(df, vec_factor))
```
