# Problem 1

The code chunk below creates a data frame comprised of a random sample
of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution, a logical vector
indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0, a
character vector of length 10, and a factor vector of length 10, with 3
different factor “levels”. It also finds the mean of each variable in
the data frame.

``` r
df = tibble(
  vec_norm = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = vec_norm > 0,
  vec_char = c("My", "name", "is", "Yihan", "Qiu", "and", "I'm", "a", "graduate", "student"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("Asian", "White", "Black", "Asian", "White", "Black", "Asian", "White", "Black", "Asian"))
)
df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    vec_norm vec_logical vec_char vec_factor
    ##       <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1   0.917  TRUE        My       Asian     
    ##  2   0.470  TRUE        name     White     
    ##  3  -0.802  FALSE       is       Black     
    ##  4   1.06   TRUE        Yihan    Asian     
    ##  5   0.244  TRUE        Qiu      White     
    ##  6   0.615  TRUE        and      Black     
    ##  7   0.0311 TRUE        I'm      Asian     
    ##  8  -0.204  FALSE       a        White     
    ##  9   1.30   TRUE        graduate Black     
    ## 10  -0.784  FALSE       student  Asian

The code chunk below finds the mean of each variable in the data frame.
