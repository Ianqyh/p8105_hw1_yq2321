# Problem 1

The code chunk below creates a data frame comprised of a random sample
of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution, a logical vector
indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0, a
character vector of length 10, and a factor vector of length 10, with 3
different factor “levels”. It also finds the mean of each variable in
the data frame.

``` r
df = tibble(
  vec_norm = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = vec_norm > 0,
  vec_char = c("My", "name", "is", "Yihan", "Qiu", "and", "I'm", "a", "graduate", "student"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("Asian", "White", "Black", "Asian", "White", "Black", "Asian", "White", "Black", "Asian"))
)
df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    vec_norm vec_logical vec_char vec_factor
    ##       <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1   -0.518 FALSE       My       Asian     
    ##  2    0.412 TRUE        name     White     
    ##  3    0.385 TRUE        is       Black     
    ##  4   -0.796 FALSE       Yihan    Asian     
    ##  5    1.48  TRUE        Qiu      White     
    ##  6   -0.177 FALSE       and      Black     
    ##  7    2.07  TRUE        I'm      Asian     
    ##  8    0.973 TRUE        a        White     
    ##  9   -1.03  FALSE       graduate Black     
    ## 10    1.65  TRUE        student  Asian

The code chunk below finds the mean of each variable in the data frame.

``` r
## Takes the mean of the random sample and it works
mean_vec_norm = mean(pull(df,vec_norm))
mean_vec_norm
```

    ## [1] 0.4442614

``` r
## Takes the mean of the logical vector and it works
mean_vec_logical = mean(pull(df, vec_logical))
mean_vec_logical
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
## Takes the mean of the character vector and it doesn't work
mean_vec_char = mean(pull(df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

``` r
mean_vec_char
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
## Takes the mean of the vector factor and it doesn't work
mean_vec_factor = mean(pull(df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_vec_factor
```

    ## [1] NA

The code chunk below tries to convert variables from one type to
another.

``` r
## Convert logical variable into numeric
as.numeric(pull(df, vec_logical))

## Convert character variable into numeric
as.numeric(pull(df, vec_char))

## Convert factor variable into numeric
as.numeric(pull(df, vec_factor))
```

We succeeded when trying to convert logical and factor variables into
numeric, but we failed when trying to convert character variable into
numeric. This suggests that function as.numeric() may not be applicable
to character variables. It helps explain what happened when trying to
take the mean of each variable as function mean() is only applicable to
numeric or logical variables.

# Problem 2

The code chunk below loads the ‘penguins’ dataset.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The code chunk below modifies the penguin dataset by eliminating NAs
from flipper\_length\_mm.

``` r
penguin_modified = drop_na(penguins, flipper_length_mm)
```

The names of important variables are species, island, bill\_length\_mm,
bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm, body\_mass\_g, sex, year.

The size of the dataset is 344 x 8.

The mean flipper length is 200.9152047.

The code chuk below makes a scatterplot of flipper length and bill
length and saves it.

``` r
x = pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm)
y = pull(penguins, bill_depth_mm)
plot_df = tibble(x,y)

## A colored scatterplot of flipper length (x) and bill depth (y).
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = pull(penguins,species))) + geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
