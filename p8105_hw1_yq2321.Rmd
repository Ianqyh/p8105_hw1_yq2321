# Problem 1

The code chunk below creates a data frame comprised of a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution, a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0, a character vector of length 10, and a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”. It also finds the mean of each variable in the data frame.

```{r}
df = tibble(
  vec_norm = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = vec_norm > 0,
  vec_char = c("My", "name", "is", "Yihan", "Qiu", "and", "I'm", "a", "graduate", "student"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("Asian", "White", "Black", "Asian", "White", "Black", "Asian", "White", "Black", "Asian"))
)
df
```
